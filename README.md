# Publishing API

An application to route requests between multiple content-store
endpoints based on whether they're live or in other states.

## Running the test suite

You can run the tests locally by running the following: `make`. This
will use the gom tool to vendorise dependencies into a folder within
the project.

You can download the gom tool by running:
`go get github.com/mattn/gom`.
